The data on this site were curated by the [Evans Policy Analysis and Research Group](https://evans.uw.edu/policy-impact/epar) (EPAR) at the [Daniel J. Evans School of Public Policy and Governance](https://evans.uw.edu/) of the [University of Washington](https://uw.edu). The raw data were collected as part of the [LSMS-ISA](http://surveys.worldbank.org/lsms/programs/integrated-surveys-agriculture-ISA) conducted by the [World Bank Group](http://www.worldbank.org/) and can be downloaded from their site.

For each country the data were collected by the respective country's Statistical Bureau. For more information on each survey and to download the data see the following links:

- [Tanzania National Panel Survey (TNPS)](http://surveys.worldbank.org/lsms/programs/integrated-surveys-agriculture-ISA/tanzania)

The data were curated using the [STATA](https://www.stata.com/) software package. The STATA source code files used to curate the data can be found on [Github](https://github.com) in [EPAR's repositories](https://github.com/EvansSchoolPolicyAnalysisAndResearch/335_Agricultural-Indicator-Curation). These files, along with the data from the World Bank's site can be used to recreate these estimates. General decision rules for this curation are detailed below."""
