Policy Analysis and Research Group](https://evans.uw.edu/policy-impact/epar)
(EPAR) at the [Daniel J. Evans School of Public Policy and
Governance](https://evans.uw.edu/) of the [University of
Washington](https://uw.edu). The raw data were collected as part of the
[LSMS-ISA](http://surveys.worldbank.org/lsms/programs/integrated-surveys-agriculture-ISA)
conducted by the [World Bank Group](http://www.worldbank.org/) and can be
downloaded from their site.

For each country the data were collected by the respective country's Statistical Bureau. For more information on each survey and to download the data see the following links:

* [Ethiopa Socioeconomic Survey (ESS)](http://surveys.worldbank.org/lsms/programs/integrated-surveys-agriculture-ISA/ethiopia)
* [Nigeria General Household Survey Panel (GHSP)](http://surveys.worldbank.org/lsms/programs/integrated-surveys-agriculture-ISA/nigeria)
* [Tanzania National Panel Survey (TNPS)](http://surveys.worldbank.org/lsms/programs/integrated-surveys-agriculture-ISA/tanzania)

The data were curated using the [STATA](https://www.stata.com/) software
package. The STATA source code files used to curate the data can be found on
[Github](https://github.com) in [EPAR's
repositories](https://github.com/EvansSchoolPolicyAnalysisAndResearch/335_Agricultural-Indicator-Curation).
These files, along with the data from the World Bank's site can be used to
recreate these estimates. General decision rules for this curation are detailed
below."""
